# Changelog

All notable changes to HDTN will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

* Fix bug where LtpSessionReceiver::NextDataToSend used a reference (reportSegmentIt) after queue.pop().
* Separate the LtpSessionSender data into high-priority-time-critical and low-priority-first-pass queues.  First pass data is lowest priority compared to time-critical data (e.g. report acks), so this priority separation prevents long first passes from starving and expiring the time-critical data.
* Static analysis fix for non-throw versions of `boost::property_tree::ptree::get_child` which return a reference to a destroyed second parameter.

### Added

* Config file additions:
    - add: `bufferRxToStorageOnLinkUpSaturation` (boolean default=`false`) to the hdtn global configs
    - add: `maxSumOfBundleBytesInPipeline` (`uint64_t`) to the outducts
    - add: `delaySendingOfDataSegmentsTimeMsOrZeroToDisable` (default=`20`) to LTP outducts for efficiently handling out-of-order report segments by deferring data retransmission.
    - add: `delaySendingOfReportSegmentsTimeMsOrZeroToDisable` (default=`20`) to LTP inducts for efficiently handling out-of-order data segments by deferring report retransmission.
    - add: Experimental feature `keepActiveSessionDataOnDisk` (boolean default=`false`) to both LTP inducts and outducts for supporting the running of LTP sessions (both for receivers and senders) from a solid-state disk drive in lieu of keeping session data-segments in memory.  If this feature is enabled, it also uses the added configuration values `activeSessionDataOnDiskNewFileDurationMs` and `activeSessionDataOnDiskDirectory` to determine where on the drive to temporarily store sessions.  Note: currently if a LTP link goes down, bundles don't yet get transferred to storage and get dropped, as this is still experimental.
* Add check for unused variables when loading hdtn config json files (uses regex). Prevent hdtn from starting until unused variable is removed.
* An error is thrown on startup `if (maxBundleSizeBytes * 2) > maxSumOfBundleBytesInPipeline`
* Add `AllOutductCapabilitiesTelemetry_t` to Telemetry.h and send it from egress to ingress, storage, and scheduler
* Add override specifier to virtual methods.
* Add a ForwardListQueue template class to util as a lightweight singly-linked list queue with low memory usage, intended for queues that are not heavily used and for use in objects that are frequently created and deleted but require a queue member variable.


### Changed

* The size of an LTP session object (both for senders and receivers) has been greatly reduced by sharing a reference to common data as opposed to copying.
* All config files now use boost::filesystem::path instead of std::string.
* Config file changes:
    - rename: `bundlePipelineLimit` to `maxNumberOfBundlesInPipeline` in the outducts
    - In the example config files, the `finalDestinationEidUris` were simplified by using ipn wildcard service numbers instead of fully-qualified (although fully-qualified ipn still supported)
* Combine `IreleaseStartHdr` and `IreleaseStopHdr` into single `IreleaseChangeHdr`.
* Ingress, Egress, and Storage now use pimpl (pointer to implementation) pattern.
* Change egress to scheduler socket from pubsub to pushpull.
* Change scheduler release messages socket from `pub` to `xpub` and wait on ingress and storage to subscribe.
* Ingress and storage now know the capability of the egress outducts.  For full description, see comment under `receive.cpp` titled "Config file changes".  Storage and Ingress now split cut-through capacity of an outduct in half, and storage now shares in the cut-through capacity.  For a particular outduct, the max data it can hold in its sending pipeline shall not exceed, whatever comes first, either:
    1. More bundles than `maxNumberOfBundlesInPipeline`
    2. More total bytes of bundles than `maxSumOfBundleBytesInPipeline`
    
### Removed

* Config file removals:
    - removed these values from hdtn config (because it was moved to hdtn_distributed_defaults.json for when NOT using hdtn-one-process): `zmqIngressAddress`, `zmqEgressAddress`, `zmqStorageAddress`, `zmqSchedulerAddress`, `zmqRouterAddress`, `zmqBoundIngressToConnectingEgressPortPath`, `zmqConnectingEgressToBoundIngressPortPath`, `zmqConnectingEgressBundlesOnlyToBoundIngressPortPath`, `zmqConnectingEgressToBoundSchedulerPortPath`, `zmqBoundIngressToConnectingStoragePortPath`, `zmqConnectingStorageToBoundIngressPortPath`, `zmqConnectingStorageToBoundEgressPortPath`, `zmqBoundEgressToConnectingStoragePortPath`, `zmqBoundRouterPubSubPortPath`
    - remove: `zmqMaxMessagesPerPath`, `zmqMaxMessageSizeBytes`, `zmqRegistrationServerAddress`, and `zmqRegistrationServerPortPath` from hdtn global configs
* Removed `release-message-sender` and `multiple-release-message-sender` executables
